# Aldery


## About


Aldery is a script that, when run after a Fedora Linux installation, will auto-install, configure and optimize the system to something that will eventually be ported from Fedora to, probably, Void and become a separate distribution.


The whole fun is that I have no idea what will come out of it. Probably a new and better nail hammer.


## Usage


You can simply run the installation script from the repository's root directory.


```

curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balintkiraly/vopi/master/install.sh

sh install.sh

```
